# Flaticulation: Laser Cutting Joints with Articulated Angles

The Flaticulation user interface 1) unfolds a user-loaded 3D model and adds corresponding articulated joints on a 2D plan or 2) have articulated joints / detent hinges applied on to selected edges.

It works as a plugin to Rhino using Grasshopper; open _Flaticulation-UI.gh_ with Grasshopper to use the software. 
The user interface currently only supports Windows.
